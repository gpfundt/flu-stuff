# Flu Info Project 

I always hear mixed opinions that the flu vaccinations aren't accurate enough each year to really work so I wanted to use this project to track the level of severity of the flu in each state vs the immunization coveraage in each state over the last few years. 

I was impressed to find that state by state the level of flu was conversly related to the level of immunization coverage (normalized by population). You can see this by flipping through the years on my maps page of this website.

I also wanted to see if states with more densly populated cities had a higher level of flu activity as I expected the flu to spread more quickly in urban areas. I did not find any 

I also have never been sure when flu season really starts and ends so I wanted to see at what time each year the flu was the worst. On the line graph page on my website you can see that the level of flu activity per week for each year found that flu season frequently between the 44th week and the 8th week of the next year. I was also surprised that there was frequently a second peak of flu levels!
